1_1 normal swap-backed&file-backed page map, read and Write
1_2 c string covers two pages
1_3 fork with empty arena, then yield
1_4 read swap-backed page many times
2_2 fork with non-empty arena, then yield
2_4 nested forks (fork in fork)
2_8 more nested forks (fork in fork in fork in fork)
3_2 read large file
3_3 two separate parent&child pairs
3_5 random write in large file
4_1 filename does not exist
5_1 map many swap-backed pages and test the evict sequence
5_3 number of virtual pages (swap-backed) exceed the size of the arena
5_4 number of virtual pages (file-backed) exceed the size of the arena
6_1 map with a filename that is half outside the arena
6_3 copy and write
6_4 too many swap-backed pages
7_1 continuously yield twice
7_2 yield before fork
8_1 map many swap-backed pages to the zero page and then fork and read/write
8_2 swap block
8_3 map many file-backed pages in the parent

original page get evicted on copy on write
both original page & child page get evicted (should go to different swap back slots)
